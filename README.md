# Classlist

This is a gradle plugin that lists all the classes available in the current project. It is light and has zero dependencies.

The classlist Gradle Plugin was developed for vim autocompletion.

It lists your classes and dependent classes. It finds classes from:

1. The JRE
2. The Project Source Set
3. Project Dependencies

To select a class on command line you can use the amazing [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
